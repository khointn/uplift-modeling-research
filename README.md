## Uplift Modeling

Uplift Modeling is a marketing modeling technique that directly models the incremental impact of a treatment (marketing action, campaign, strategy) on an individual's behaviors. 

From those predictions (by using previous & historical data of all users and applying Uplift Modeling), marketers can understand customers' reaction and behavior on a treatment, then decide the most suitable strategy or evaluate the effect of the treatment directly, and put more effort on the well-performed treatment to maximize our ROI. 

It is hard to define the correct group of users for treatment. Therefore, it is necessary to apply Machine Learning to learn whether the group we chose truly response positive to our treatment. 

This repo includes my report on Uplift Modeling, and a demo Notebook, which I used public data from Criteo AI Lab (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/uplift-modeling) to build model.
